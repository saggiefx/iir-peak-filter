# EQ Notch/Peak Filter

🎉 **Project Closed**

This repository has been successfully closed upon the completion of the tutorial series. It was designed as a learning resource, particularly for students in their initial phases.

## Project Overview

This project introduced a simple cutoff filter plugin designed with learning in mind, especially for new students. The implemented peak filter enabled users to adjust the following parameters:

- **Gain Control:** Modify the amplification or attenuation of the filtered signal.
- **Bandwidth Control:** Adjust the width of the frequency band affected by the filter.
- **Cutoff Frequency Control:** Set the central frequency where the peak filter is applied.

The primary goal of this project was to provide a practical reference for students to comprehend the essentials of audio signal processing and plugin development. The emphasis was on simplicity and clarity to enhance the learning experience.
